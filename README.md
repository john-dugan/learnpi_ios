# Learn Pi

Unfortunately I don't have the time to continue development on this app anymore, so now it's open sourced!

The code is essentially the same from the 2.0 release in Feb. 2015, with only a few changes for Xcode 10 and iOS 12 compatibility.

This project is in desperate need of refactoring and modernization, so pull requests are welcome!
